This package is heavily based on fonty package by Marcin 'Qrczak' Kowalczyk
(http://kki.net.pl/qrczak/programy/linux/fonty/).
Some glyphs are obtained from GNU unifont by David Starner
(http://dvdeug.dhis.org/unifont.html), originally by Roman Czyborra
(http://www.czyborra.com).

To build fonts: run build.sh script.
To modify fonts: edit files in source/ directory.
To add new charsets: add *.txt file into charsets/ directory.

To use fonts: there are two small scripts provided, iso and utf8.
iso takes as an argument number of ISO-8859 encoding, switching 
console font into font for that encoding, and utf8 switches console
into Unicode mode, using big Unicode font. See manpages
for details.

About fonts:

LatCyrGr-16.psf is font containing most of ISO Latin characters,
lot of cyrillic chars, lot of greek chars, and some punctuation.
It is good for Unicode linux console. This is 512 character
font, means that you lose bold colour on linux console, unless
you are using framebuffer.

chavo.psf is font containing lot of ISO-8859-2 repertoire,
some additional ISO-8859-1 characters, Russian cyrillic
characters and special Esperanto characters. It was
specifically created to cover Czech, Slovak, Polish,
Hungarian, Russian, German, Esperanto. Of course, it accidentally
covers much wider range :-)
Good as a console font if you want to retain bold colours
(and do not need some ISO-8859-1 characters - there was
simply not enough space for them).

uni-compact-16.sbf.gz - compact Unicode source font -
good for use with dynafont (part of fonty package).


about glyphs:
glyphs from Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A,
as well as most often used Cyrillic and Greek are verified, with
consistent typography. Characters from other ranges need some work
- mostly shifting by one or two pixels, and redrawing them with
consistent width.
